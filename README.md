# Physician Talking to Patient (P2P)

This is a full stack projects with the use of node.js, express.js and PostgreSQL at the backend

My intentions with building this app are the following reasons. Firstly, I wanted to explore a bit deepr the methology of architechuring
relational database such as PostgreSQL. Second of all, in view of the recent global event, I was planning on to build a web based
application that can offer convenience for physicians' ability in giving diagnosis to patients showing mild symtopms online so that the patient
don't need to go to doctors very frequently. 

This app will be eventually extended to iOS and Android version.
