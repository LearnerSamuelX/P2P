# Physician Talking to Patient (P2P)

This is a full stack project with the use of node.js, express.js and PostgreSQL at the backend

My intentions with building this app are the following reasons. Firstly, I wanted to explore a bit deepr the methology of architechuring
relational database such as PostgreSQL. Second of all, in view of the recent global event, I was planning on building a web based
application that can offer convenience to physicians and patients and give them the ability in giving/viewing the diagnosis of mild symtopms sickness/diseases online so that the patients don't need to go to visit doctors' office very frequently.

The core difference manifested between **P2P** and regular communication tools(email/ceil phones) is, the **P2P** has a structured database from which all saved recored can be queried in a designated format. 

This app will be eventually extended to iOS and Android versions.
